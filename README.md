**University:** 8 Mai 1945 Guelma University  
**Program:** Master's in Computer Science  
**Module:** Networking and Server Administration

## **Repository Overview**  
This repository documents my practical work for the **Networking and Server Administration** module. It includes lab implementations of:  
- IP addressing (VLSM, subnetting)  
- DHCP server Configuration and Usage  
- Switching  
- VLANs
- Access Control Lists

Each lab features a detailed report, configuration files (.pkt), and verification screenshots.

## **Lab Portfolio**  

### **Lab 1: VLSM IP Addressing**  
- **Objective:** Design a VLSM plan for a company with 5 departments.  
- **Key Skills:** Subnet calculation, router interface configuration



### **Lab 2: DHCP Server Configuration**  
- **Objective:** Implement a multi-subnet DHCP server with relay agent.
- **Key Skills:** DHCP pool creation, IP helper-address


### **Lab 3: Switching and ARP Basics**  
- **Objective:** Analyze MAC learning/forwarding and ARP resolution.
- **Key Skills:** Switch MAC table analysis, ARP cache management


### **Lab 4: VLAN Configuration**  
- **Objective:** Segment a LAN into student/faculty VLANs.
- **Key Skills:** VLAN creation, trunk port configuration


### **Lab 5: Access Control Lists Configuration**  
- **Objective:** Implement ACLs to control traffic flow and secure network access
- **Key Skills:**
1. Configure standard and extended ACLs
2. Apply ACLs to router interfaces
3. Test and verify ACL functionality

## **How to Use**  
1. **View Reports:** Open `README.md` for detailed explanations.  
2. **Simulate Networks:** Load `.pkt` files in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
3. **Reproduce Results:** Follow configurations in reports.
